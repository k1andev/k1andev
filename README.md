ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kian (@k1andev)

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in
  - Software / GUI development in C#
  - library/backend development

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my own immediate mode GUI toolkit (hydrogen) for C#
--> Make sure to check out hydrogen!

âš¡ Fun fact: developing desktop apps on mac sucks.
